# Better Make Shapes

Small app using the Fyne toolkit and Go. 

Use the buttons to manipulate the shape!

## Design Choices

I chose to split the display in two sections using a Horizintal Box with the buttons on the left wrapped in a Vertical Box. 
I wanted the lines which make up the shape be the main focus so afforded maximum space for this whilst keeping the main window size tight. The container used to hold the lines is "without layout" as I had initially intended to move the shape as well as rotating it around the centre origin, however I felt I was taking more than the two hours allotted to me, so I did not add this functionality. The Fyne toolkit is very intuitive and I also really enjoyed my first experience with Go. I hope you enjoy looking at and spinning the shape as much as I enjoyed making it!
